This adds some useful functionality to the mechanize scraping tool. It uses
lxml not BeautifulSoup and provides a nice interface to it via the
mechanize_gears.Scraping class.

You can inherit from multiple classes from mechanize_gears in your own class
to gain the features of all of them, i.e. inherit IE Spoofing and Scraping.

Add stuff, take it from here put it into mechanize... do as ye will...
